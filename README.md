# vim config

This repo contains my vim configuration.

I'm by no means a programmer, but I do spend a fair amount of time writing `Markdown` on a tiny screen.

My configuration intends to make writing as easy as possible:

+ no `statusline` salient information is in the `ruler` instead
+ Spell-checking on by default, and can be toggled using `<F5>`
+ templates for shell scripts and journal posts

## TODO

+ toggles to remove numbers and ruler for a more 'Zen' experience.
+ tweak colours to look more consistent
